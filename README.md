### Hi there, my nickname is Aave ðŸ‘‹ I'm VB.NET developer and technology enthusiast. <br />
Why Visual Basic? This is not cool, yes? ðŸ¤”<br />

Well, from the beginning, I'm not a professional programm developer and started from the sciense environment.<br />
In my institute VB was the preferred development choise because of it's:
- powerful (all the .NET possibilities)
- human-readable syntax and expressive statements ðŸ˜„
- low entry threshold 
- and rapid development cycle âš¡<br />

Further, when I came into professional software development, I saw that VB is totally covers all the needs of my tasks. So my company didn't mind of using it. <br />

In my work I often come across of low-level development and using of libraries for the hardware devices. VB.NET allows deal with it pretty fine. And I came to conclusion that it is better to dig deep into the chosen technology than to scatter attention to many things at all.

### So, welcome to my page and I hope my code will helps someone.
